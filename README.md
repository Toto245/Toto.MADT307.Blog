### Assignment #9 - Internet of things

At first this looks like an economic policy question. the argument first made by Warren is how a very large and powerful tech industry is reaching into other markets such as the car industry (ie turning cars into “smart cars” for simplicity and argument sake). And this issue state is that competitors have neither the tech or the resources to compete with the tech industries such as google/amazon/apple etc, adding another industry to the list of industries now significantly dominated by the Tech giants. Now I think this is a bad argument, because economically this makes sense! not to turn this into an econ lecture so to state this argument quickly (although not doing it much justice) a larger “organization has the necessary resources and manpower to better organize resource distribution, research, and over all greater efficiency to provide a product or service than compared to a series of small companies without these advantages. The best analogy I can think of is trying to rule a society as one kingdom, or a bunch of petty independent counties. Let’s also not forget that these pictures the tech giants are portraying is user devices being connected for user friendly experiences and conveniency. So, on the surface I disagree with warren’s argument, no one cares about “competition” because 1 large central organized force will always have the ability to outperform petty smaller companies in all fields, which means better products/services for the users and a larger guarantee of reliability. 

Despite this argument which sounds like approval of another market being influenced and taken over by a bigger and better equipped Tech Industry I still agree with the over all position of Warren. This is because of a simple and undeniably true fact. United States “Big tech” companies are hands down one of the most ethically and morally bankrupt companies my generation will be under the oppression of in our current lifetime. They sit right next to the fossil fuel industry and defense contractor companies that lobby our government and in simple terms, poison our earth and our societies. However, most of those companies’ actions are foreign investments (Imperialism), while big tech directly influences our lives here. They break every conceivable privacy and labor laws with little to zero consequences. They poison and lobby our government to make sure their power remains unchallenged.

just one of the many examples of crimes going unpunished.

at least one conclusion can be made here from this quick argument, the US people do not have a government to protect them because US leadership doesn’t sit at the white house, in senate or the house etc, (they are simply mask over a hallow face of leadership). They sit at the board of directors table of our largest industries, shareholders and powerful families fueled by capital wealth, making decisions of what and how our society should operate (in servitude to them in every degree). Not only did we not choose these people to govern our society, they intentionally abuse their power to meet their individual priorities over the priorities of our society. this is how we end up with one of one of the wealthies countries in the world yet with the largest gap of wealth inequaility.

### Assignment #8 - Inclusive Gaming
Inclusive gaming is a social issue with the Gaming industry which there is no good reason for why gaming shouldn't have a player demographic relatively even across the board. Based the games in the last 20 years it is safe to say that the targeted audience has been mostly at boys/men and who are of white skin color.  For most of the Triple A games (The term "AAA Games" is a classification used within the video gaming industry to signify high-budget, high-profile games that are typically produced and distributed by large, well-known publishers. These games often rank as “blockbusters” due to their extreme popularity.) [Arm.com/aaa-games] the theme is resolved around some form of violence where the main character is white male, similar theme we see among comic books and superhero industry as well. 

To share from my own experiences, I would like to state that I’ve been playing video games from a very young age. I have made friends through this experience through the years and now most gaming communities use Discord (Instant messaging social platform. Users can communicate with voice calls, text messaging, and media and files) to communicate better such as a tight network of friends. Now in my experience in my chosen gaming communities, we have plenty of girls who join and play games with us that are treated as equals such as any other friend. But with any public game there is always going to be a hand full of random strangers who will make a misogynistic comment which is clearly inappropriate. I believe now compared to 10 years ago the casual gamer community has improved and video games are creating more “main character” customization selections to fill most needs for demographics within the game. 

This however does not mean that the job is in any way finished. On one part the gaming industry needs to continue this trend of more character design options for the player, and more broad audience targeting even when it comes to more advertisement of video games. Also, the professional esports need to get girls more involved in the professional world as well. There is no reason a girl could not play on the same stage as the boys since almost all professionals are men. However, I would personally start building some girl own leagues to grow the base further to increase the talent and player base. Then combined the two leagues together once that goal is achieved. There is also a responsibility with our influences and educational fields to promote equality and safe community that isn’t prejudice based of gender or ethnicity.

### Assignment #7 - Digital Divide
10/14/2022

The digital divide Is a serious problem and something that should have a larger priority within our country especially based on how developed we are as a nation. We have both the work force and the economy/resources to achieve this and there is real necessity to get this done and improve society. 
as human society moves further into the modern era our reliance on technology and specifically access to the internet increases. It’s were we hear about the news, find and apply for jobs, learn and teach, find entertainment etc. This list can go on forever that it is safe to say that it is factually impossible to live without it in a developed country. To be able to access the internet individuals need access to computers and Wi-Fi. For the US we have one of the most expensive services and not guaranteed coverage. Obviously like many things related to US domestic policy. Low-income families are left without this necessity and middle income families struggle to make the bills on time every month. 

The way to fix it is an incredibly controversial subject because the solution relates to many other possible solutions which unfortunately goes against some people’s political/economic views. This isn’t a local problem or a state problem (in relation to our country) this is a federal (national) problem. We lack a government which prioritizes the necessities to its populous do to (in this scenario) internet companies lobbying for personal profit. This should not be a controversial fact https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/07/isps-spent-235-million-on-lobbying-and-donations-more-than-320000-a-day/ . this is a repetitive story with all our domestic policies.

I believe that Internet access is in fact a necessity therefore a priority for the government to provide to all of its citizens and this goal is extremely achievable.

this article is quite interesting as it goes into some prodections we will see in the future when it comes to social media. for example, the expansion of video content and commercial advertisment. local targeting will grow which in my opinion is an extreme ethical issue when it comes to privacy rights. and tiktok will most likely continue growing possibly larger than instagram/facebook

### Assignment #3 - Kickstart Start
9/09/2022

Remote learning and working technology have had a significant impact on our society that we haven’t seen before in human history till now. It interests me because before technological advances the only way to learn something without the help of others is through books. Now at the time not everyone could read, books were limited, and it was most likely difficult to find the exact book you need let alone if the information was accurate or not. Now because of the availability of the internet, all sources on anything you want is literally at your fingertips. They way people properly learn was through others and more so in person. But with the use of internet people are able to educate each other remotely as we are now all digitally connected. Learning has also in ways became easier, when we compare lecturing to creative videos, podcasts, websites etc. learning has become more than just audio learning, but a visual experience with the creativeness a computer and internet offers. We even see since the covid pandemic classrooms don’t necessarily have to be in person, an impossible foot before the use of internet. Now classrooms can be filled virtually through a computer.

This technology hasn't only affected the classroom but work as well. Again, since the pandemic work was something, you go to not something you had the luxury to be at home for. But since work for primarily white-collar labor was in the office, people released while stuck at home that the home could be just as productive or potentially more for some at home. The indirect effect was the damage to office culture, as we see across the states many offices remain vacant despite people return to work after the pandemic. Something interesting would be examining the indirect effects of this. We see how the office culture was effected but will it dramatically effort school culture as well?
