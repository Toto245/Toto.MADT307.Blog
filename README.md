I grew up in the Bay Area and after high school attended a local junior college for four years. after which I transferred to Chico to finish my studies for a BS in Mechanical Engineering. I am in my senior year and excited to have gotten this far with difficult degree and I'm glad to finally see the finish line coming soon. for the summer I interned for a General Contractor in San Francisco in which I joined a project team assigned to the management and construction of a 20 story affordable living high-rise building in the middle of Soma.
