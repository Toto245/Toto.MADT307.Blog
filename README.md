### Assignment #7 - Digital Divide
10/14/2022

The digital divide Is a serious problem and something that should have a larger priority within our country especially based on how developed we are as a nation. We have both the work force and the economy/resources to achieve this and there is real necessity to get this done and improve society. 
as human society moves further into the modern era our reliance on technology and specifically access to the internet increases. It’s were we hear about the news, find and apply for jobs, learn and teach, find entertainment etc. This list can go on forever that it is safe to say that it is factually impossible to live without it in a developed country. To be able to access the internet individuals need access to computers and Wi-Fi. For the US we have one of the most expensive services and not guaranteed coverage. Obviously like many things related to US domestic policy. Low-income families are left without this necessity and middle income families struggle to make the bills on time every month. 

The way to fix it is an incredibly controversial subject because the solution relates to many other possible solutions which unfortunately goes against some people’s political/economic views. This isn’t a local problem or a state problem (in relation to our country) this is a federal (national) problem. We lack a government which prioritizes the necessities to its populous do to (in this scenario) internet companies lobbying for personal profit. This should not be a controversial fact https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/07/isps-spent-235-million-on-lobbying-and-donations-more-than-320000-a-day/ . this is a repetitive story with all our domestic policies.

I believe that Internet access is in fact a necessity therefore a priority for the government to provide to all of its citizens and this goal is extremely achievable.

1. Ostic, D., Qalati, S., Barbosa, B., Shah, S., Galvan Vela, E., Herzallah, A., & Liu, F. (0001, January 01). Effects of social media use on psychological well-being: A mediated model. Retrieved September 28, 2022, from https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.678766/full

this article is an interesting journal entry on the effects of social media use on phsychological well being. there are conserns of addiction and phsychological damage social media has displayed on the user and in turn society. its not all negative for there is a sense of "connectedness" social media provides to people around the world. communities connected through the interent and communicated through social media that we have not seen in human history till the modern era. this article goes into the pros and cons of social media and how we access it.

this article is quite interesting as it goes into some prodections we will see in the future when it comes to social media. for example, the expansion of video content and commercial advertisment. local targeting will grow which in my opinion is an extreme ethical issue when it comes to privacy rights. and tiktok will most likely continue growing possibly larger than instagram/facebook

### Assignment #3 - Kickstart Start
9/09/2022

Remote learning and working technology have had a significant impact on our society that we haven’t seen before in human history till now. It interests me because before technological advances the only way to learn something without the help of others is through books. Now at the time not everyone could read, books were limited, and it was most likely difficult to find the exact book you need let alone if the information was accurate or not. Now because of the availability of the internet, all sources on anything you want is literally at your fingertips. They way people properly learn was through others and more so in person. But with the use of internet people are able to educate each other remotely as we are now all digitally connected. Learning has also in ways became easier, when we compare lecturing to creative videos, podcasts, websites etc. learning has become more than just audio learning, but a visual experience with the creativeness a computer and internet offers. We even see since the covid pandemic classrooms don’t necessarily have to be in person, an impossible foot before the use of internet. Now classrooms can be filled virtually through a computer.

This technology hasn't only affected the classroom but work as well. Again, since the pandemic work was something, you go to not something you had the luxury to be at home for. But since work for primarily white-collar labor was in the office, people released while stuck at home that the home could be just as productive or potentially more for some at home. The indirect effect was the damage to office culture, as we see across the states many offices remain vacant despite people return to work after the pandemic. Something interesting would be examining the indirect effects of this. We see how the office culture was effected but will it dramatically effort school culture as well?
